    "Name": " Precisely targeted neuromodulation of pain circuits using MR guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and simultaneously acquired functional MRI ",
    "Data Description": "Two sets of fMRI data acquired using different stimulus paradigms i.e., Two and three-stimulus condition EPI data 1) Heat & Heat+FUS (sub-01-03, 20-runs) and 2) Heat, Heat+FUS & FUS (sub-04&05, 7-runs). FUS was applied to the VPL nuclei located in the Thalamus during simultaneous Heat+FUS and FUS only conditions where total acquisition time was 674 and 996 seconds for the two and three-condition data. Alternate Heat and Heat+FUS was presented in the former data set for 16s followed by 30s rest. Stimulus on time for both conditions are Heat: 30 122 214 306 398 490 582sec and Heat+FUS: 76 168 260 352 444 536 628sec. However, 3-conditions data was acquired using a randomized stimulus paradigm where stimulus presentation timings are as follows. Heat: 30 168 398 490 628 812 858sec., Heat+FUS: 76 260 306 444 674 766 904sec. and FUS: 122 214 352 536 582 720 950sec. Twenty-two resting runs of 6 macaque monkeys were also acquired to analyze the difference in resting state functional activity after performing basic pre-processing (motion correction and slice timing). With TR = 2.0secs an ascending and interleaved slice timing acquisition protocol was followed to acquire EPI data",
